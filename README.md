Towhoe 6: EOSD is a complete ripoff of the bullet hell game [Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil).

It is a vertical-scrolling bullet hell (danmaku) shooter, basically its Galaga.

# How to play
Launch the game and click the buttons to start and learn idiot

z - shoot gun

x - use bomb (big ability)

left shift - focus mode (move slower, tighter bullet spread, reveal hitbox)

# Credits
